                <p>Yep, another bitcoin wallet. But why? I wanted to see the capabilities of <a href="https://bitcoindevkit.org/" target="_blank">bdk</a>. And I have to admit I was impressed with how it works.</p>
                <p>Bdk provides you an awesome high level interface for develop bitcoin wallets without difficulties. As far as I explored I think it could be a good option for simple wallet of "beginner friendly wallet's".</p>
                <p>In my opinion for build more advanced wallets you would need to implement extra features and add external tools for achieve things like managing utxo's or fee estimation. In this point I want to say thanks to the bitcoin development kit team and congratulate them for their great work. When I was doing the project they helped my with a couple of github issues very quickly. The team is very active and they're open to help others.</p>

                <p>Should you use bdk? Yep 100%, it will bost your wallet development project.</p>
