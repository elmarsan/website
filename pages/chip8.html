                <p>Since I was a child I have played with emulators. I knew they are complex to programe. But I understimated how complex this task can be.</p>
                <p>People experienced building emulator recommend to start digging in this world by doing the chip8. Hence this is the kind of proyect we could consider the "Hello World" of emulation.</p>
                <p>Personally I enjoyed this project like a child. It was very funny to come back and review some low-level computing fundamentals.</p>
    
                <br/>
    
                <p>I would like to recommend everyone to give a try to chip8 emulation and do your own implementation.</p>
